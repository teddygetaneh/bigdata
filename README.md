# bigdata
This repository contains the code for an e-commerce data pipeline project. The pipeline processes and analyzes product data from an e-commerce platform, allowing for insights, trend analysis, and potential business applications.

Overview The data pipeline consists of the following stages:

Data Collection: Collection of e-commerce product data and sentiment data. Data Transformation: Cleaning, transforming, and processing raw data into structured formats. Data Storage: Storing the transformed data in a PostgreSQL database. Data Visualization: Visualizing key e-commerce metrics using Business Intelligence (BI) tools. Insights and Analysis: Generating insights based on data trends and correlations. Data Due to file size restrictions, the transformed CSV file cannot be uploaded to GitHub. Please follow the steps below to obtain and use the data:

Download the Data: The transformed e-commerce data is available for download from [https://www.kaggle.com/code/parkash058/amzon-uk-product-2023-data-analysis] (e.g., a cloud storage link such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3). Data File Structure: transformed_amazon_data.csv: The main data file containing processed e-commerce product information. How to Use the Data: After downloading the CSV file, you can load it into your PostgreSQL database using the provided schema. Use the COPY or \copy commands to import the data into your database. Requirements The following tools and libraries are required for running the project:

Python 3.x PostgreSQL Pandas Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations) psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL connection) Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Power BI, Looker, etc. Installation To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/teddygetaneh/bigdata.git cd ecommerce-data-pipeline Install Dependencies: Make sure you have the required Python libraries:

bash Copy Edit pip install -r requirements.txt Database Setup:

Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database connection. Load the transformed data into the database using the instructions above. Run the Data Pipeline:

Run the Python scripts to process, analyze, and visualize the data. Usage Once the data is loaded into the database, you can create interactive dashboards and reports using tools like Power BI or Looker to visualize trends, customer segmentation, and other key metrics.
